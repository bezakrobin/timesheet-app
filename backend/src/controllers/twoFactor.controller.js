 * TODO: Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) controller logic in this file (twoFactor.controller.js).
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Import necessary modules:
 * - User model
 * - Authenticator library (e.g., 'speakeasy' or 'otplib') for TOTP generation/verification
 * - QR code generation library (e.g., 'qrcode') if using authenticator apps
 * - Email service utility (if using email 2FA)
 * - crypto (for generating recovery codes)
 * - Any utility functions (e.g., error handling)
 *
 * 2. Implement the `setup` function:
 * - Get user ID from authenticated request (req.user).
 * - Get desired 2FA type from request body ({ type: 'email' | 'authenticator' }).
 * - If type is 'authenticator':
 * - Generate a new TOTP secret using the authenticator library.
 * - Store the secret (encrypted recommended) temporarily or directly with the user record (mark as unverified).
 * - Generate the OTPAuth URL (otpauth://totp/...).
 * - Generate a QR code image from the OTPAuth URL.
 * - Return the QR code (e.g., as a data URL) and the secret (optional, for manual entry) to the client.
 * - If type is 'email':
 * - Indicate that email 2FA setup will proceed upon first verification (or simply enable it if no verification step needed).
 * - Return success message.
 * - Handle cases where 2FA is already enabled/partially set up.
 *
 * 3. Implement the `verify` function:
 * - Determine context: Is this verifying during login, or confirming setup? (May need different inputs like userId, tempToken, or rely on req.user).
 * - Get the 2FA code and type from the request body ({ code, type, userId?, tempToken? }).
 * - Find the user (based on userId, tempToken, or req.user).
 * - If type is 'authenticator':
 * - Retrieve the user's stored TOTP secret.
 * - Verify the provided code against the secret using the authenticator library (consider time window drift).
 * - If valid and this is the setup confirmation step, mark 2FA as enabled/verified for the user.
 * - If type is 'email':
 * - Retrieve the expected code sent via email (needs temporary storage or specific logic).
 * - Compare the provided code with the expected code.
 * - If valid and this is the setup confirmation step, mark 2FA as enabled/verified for the user.
 * - If verification is successful:
 * - If verifying during login, generate final auth tokens and return them.
 * - If confirming setup, return success message.
 * - Handle errors (invalid code, expired code, user not found).
 *
 * 4. Implement the `disable` function:
 * - Get user ID from authenticated request (req.user).
 * - Optionally, verify user's current password if provided in request body ({ password? }).
 * - If password verification passes (or is not required):
 * - Clear 2FA settings (secret, enabled status) from the user record in the database.
 * - Return success message.
 * - Handle errors (incorrect password).
 *
 * 5. Implement the `getRecoveryCodes` function:
 * - Get user ID from authenticated request (req.user).
 * - Check if 2FA is enabled for the user.
 * - Optionally, require 2FA re-verification before showing codes.
 * - Generate a set of single-use recovery codes (e.g., 10 codes, store hashed versions in DB).
 * - Return the plain text codes to the user ONCE. Emphasize they need to be saved securely.
 * - Handle errors (2FA not enabled).
 *
 * 6. Implement the `verifyRecoveryCode` function:
 * - Get user identifier (email/userId) and recovery code from request body.
 * - Find the user.
 * - Retrieve the user's stored hashed recovery codes.
 * - Hash the provided recovery code and check if it matches any of the stored hashes.
 * - If a match is found:
 * - Invalidate the used recovery code (remove it from the stored list).
 * - Consider the user authenticated for this step (e.g., bypass 2FA for login).
 * - Generate final auth tokens and return them.
 * - Handle errors (invalid code, user not found).
 *
 * 7. Export all implemented functions.
 * 8. Ensure proper error handling.
