/*
 * TODO: Implement password management controller logic in this file (password.controller.js).
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Import necessary modules:
 * - User model (e.g., from '../models/user.model')
 * - bcryptjs (for password hashing and comparison)
 * - crypto (for generating secure random tokens)
 * - Email service utility
 * - Any utility functions (e.g., error handling)
 *
 * 2. Implement the `forgotPassword` function:
 * - Validate input (email).
 * - Find the user by email.
 * - If user exists:
 * - Generate a secure password reset token.
 * - Store the hashed token and its expiry time with the user record in the database.
 * - Send an email to the user containing the password reset link (with the token).
 * - Return a generic success message (even if the email doesn't exist, to prevent enumeration).
 *
 * 3. Implement the `createNewPassword` function (also known as resetPassword):
 * - Validate input (token, newPassword).
 * - Hash the provided token (using the same method as when storing it).
 * - Find the user by the hashed reset token and check if the token is not expired.
 * - If user found and token is valid:
 * - Hash the new password using bcrypt.
 * - Update the user's password in the database.
 * - Clear the reset token fields from the user record.
 * - Return success message.
 * - Handle errors (invalid/expired token).
 *
 * 4. Implement the `changePassword` function:
 * - Get user ID from authenticated request (req.user).
 * - Validate input (currentPassword, newPassword).
 * - Find the user by ID.
 * - Compare the provided `currentPassword` with the user's stored hashed password using bcrypt.
 * - If `currentPassword` is correct:
 * - Hash the `newPassword` using bcrypt.
 * - Update the user's password in the database.
 * - Return success message.
 * - Handle errors (incorrect current password).
 *
 * 5. Export all implemented functions.
 * 6. Ensure proper error handling.
