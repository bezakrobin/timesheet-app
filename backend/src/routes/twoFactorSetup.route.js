/*
 * TODO: Implement the 2FA setup initiation route logic in this file
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Import the `express` library.
 * 2. Import the relevant controller function (e.g., `twoFactorController.setup`) from the controllers directory.
 * - Ensure the path to the controller is correct.
 * 3. Import the authentication middleware (e.g., `authMiddleware`) as setup requires login.
 * - Ensure the path to the middleware is correct.
 * 4. Create an instance of the `express.Router()`.
 * 5. Define the `POST /` route:
 * - This route should handle initiating 2FA setup for the authenticated user.
 * - Apply the authentication middleware.
 * - It should call the appropriate controller function (e.g., `twoFactorController.setup`).
 * - Add comments explaining the route, access level (Private), expected input ({ type: 'email' | 'authenticator' }),
 * and potential responses (QR code/secret for authenticator, message for email).
 * 6. Export the router instance using `module.exports`.
 *
 * Note: Mount this router under /api/auth/2fa/setup in your main app.
