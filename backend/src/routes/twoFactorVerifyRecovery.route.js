/*
 * TODO: Implement the 2FA recovery code verification route logic in this file
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Import the `express` library.
 * 2. Import the relevant controller function (e.g., `twoFactorController.verifyRecoveryCode`) from the controllers directory.
 * - Ensure the path to the controller is correct.
 * 3. Create an instance of the `express.Router()`.
 * 4. Define the `POST /` route:
 * - This route handles verifying a 2FA recovery code, typically during login when the primary 2FA method fails.
 * - It should call the appropriate controller function (e.g., `twoFactorController.verifyRecoveryCode`).
 * - Add comments explaining the route, access level (Public, requires valid code and user identifier),
 * expected input ({ email | userId, recoveryCode }), and potential responses (final auth tokens).
 * 5. Export the router instance using `module.exports`.
 *
 * Note: Mount this router under /api/auth/2fa/verify-recovery in your main app.
