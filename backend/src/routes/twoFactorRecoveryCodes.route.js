/*
 * TODO: Implement the 2FA recovery codes route logic in this file
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Import the `express` library.
 * 2. Import the relevant controller function (e.g., `twoFactorController.getRecoveryCodes`) from the controllers directory.
 * - Ensure the path to the controller is correct.
 * 3. Import the authentication middleware (e.g., `authMiddleware`) as this requires login.
 * - Consider if 2FA re-verification is needed within the controller logic.
 * - Ensure the path to the middleware is correct.
 * 4. Create an instance of the `express.Router()`.
 * 5. Define the `GET /` route:
 * - This route generates/retrieves 2FA recovery codes for the authenticated user.
 * - Apply the authentication middleware.
 * - It should call the appropriate controller function (e.g., `twoFactorController.getRecoveryCodes`).
 * - Add comments explaining the route, access level (Private),
 * and potential responses ({ recoveryCodes: string[] }).
 * 6. Export the router instance using `module.exports`.
 *
 * Note: Mount this router under /api/auth/2fa/recovery-codes in your main app.
