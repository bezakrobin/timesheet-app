/*
 * TODO: Implement the registration route logic in this file
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Import the `express` library.
 * 2. Import the relevant controller function (e.g., `authController.register`) from the controllers directory.
 * - Ensure the path to the controller is correct.
 * 3. Create an instance of the `express.Router()`.
 * 4. Define the `POST /` route:
 * - This route should handle new user registration.
 * - It should call the appropriate controller function (e.g., `authController.register`).
 * - Add comments explaining the route, expected request body (name, email, password), and potential responses.
 * 5. Export the router instance using `module.exports`.
 *
 * Note: Mount this router under /api/auth/register in your main app.
