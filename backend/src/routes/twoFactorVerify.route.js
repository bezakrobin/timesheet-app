/*
 * TODO: Implement the 2FA code verification route logic in this file
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Import the `express` library.
 * 2. Import the relevant controller function (e.g., `twoFactorController.verify`) from the controllers directory.
 * - Ensure the path to the controller is correct.
 * 3. Import authentication middleware (e.g., `authMiddleware`) if needed for your specific flow.
 * - Note: Access might be Public (e.g., verifying during login) or Private (e.g., confirming setup).
 * - Ensure the path to the middleware is correct if used.
 * 4. Create an instance of the `express.Router()`.
 * 5. Define the `POST /` route:
 * - This route should handle verifying a 2FA code.
 * - Apply authentication middleware if necessary.
 * - It should call the appropriate controller function (e.g., `twoFactorController.verify`).
 * - Add comments explaining the route, access level (Public/Private),
 * expected input ({ userId?, tempToken?, code, type }), and potential responses (success message or final tokens).
 * 6. Export the router instance using `module.exports`.
 *
 * Note: Mount this router under /api/auth/2fa/verify in your main app.
